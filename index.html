      Hey! It's me, Pres.<br><br>

      I've liked you for a while na. I don't know when it started.
      Maybe during one of our recitations? During your introduction,
      or maybe the first time you walked through those doors.<br><br>

      I made an effort to express this to you, as I promised myself not
      to leave anything unsaid before each year ends.
      I don't expect my confession to be reciprocated,
      I just want it to be acknowledged.<br><br>

      I hope this doesn't make it awkward for us,
      especially since we still have that PR1 lol.<br><br>

      Anyway, that's all. Thank you for being the reason why
      I keep pushing myself to perform better.
